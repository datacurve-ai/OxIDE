# Overview for Subtask 3

Building upon the Vim-like terminal text editor from subtasks 1 and 2, enhance the editor with Lua scripting support. This integration will allow for custom scripting and plugin functionality.

## New Requirements

1. **Lua Integration**:
   - Create a `LuaPluginManager` to handle Lua script execution and integration with the editor.
   - Implement a system to load and execute Lua scripts from a designated directory.

2. **Exposing Editor Functions to Lua**:
   - Create Lua-accessible functions that allow scripts to interact with the editor.
   - Implement at least an `insert_text` function that can be called from Lua scripts.

3. **Command Execution System**:
   - Extend the command system to handle Lua-defined commands.
   - Implement error handling for unknown or failed Lua commands.

4. **Rust-Lua Interaction**:
   - Use `Rc<RefCell<App>>` to share the `App` state between Rust and Lua safely.
   - Handle Rust's ownership and borrowing rules when interacting with Lua.

5. **File Operations**:
   - Implement file saving functionality that can be triggered from both Rust and Lua.

## Implementation Details

- Create a new module `lua_integration.rs` to handle all Lua-related functionality.
- Use a Lua crate (e.g., `rlua` or `mlua`) to embed a Lua interpreter within the Rust application.
- Implement the `LuaPluginManager` struct with methods for initialization, script loading, and command execution.
- Modify the `App` struct to include a `LuaPluginManager` instance.
- Implement error handling for Lua script execution and command processing.



Ensure your implementation does the following:
- Successful initialization of the `LuaPluginManager`.
- Execution of Lua scripts that interact with the editor (e.g., inserting text).
- Proper handling of unknown Lua commands.
- Integration of Lua functionality with existing editor features.
